Personal knowledge base of code and tech

This repository is for Code Vault, a knowledge base of what I am learning in code and tech. The goal is to continue updating the website as I learn new programming languages and technologies. As I go through programming exercises and make useful discoveries along the way, I will take notes and then update the relevant sections of Code Vault.
