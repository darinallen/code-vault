            <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>GitHub is a tool for programmers who want to use version control. It is especially useful for programmers that are collaborating on large projects, as it allows them to work on various aspects of a project simultaneously and submit their updates for approval to be incorporated into the master project. This workflow helps avoid files being overwritten and allows programmers to work concurrently without stepping on one another's toes.</p>

            <h2>The Basics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Repository:</strong> Used to organize a single project. It can hold files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets related to a project. It can also include a README and a license file.</li>

                    <li><strong>Branching:</strong> The way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.</li>

                    <li><strong>Master Branch:</strong> The definitive branch. Other branches are used to experiment and make edits before committing them to the Master branch. When creating a branch off the Master branch, you are making a copy, or snapshot, of the Master branch at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the Master branch while you were working on a different branch, you could pull in those updates. Branches accomplish similar goals that saving different versions of a file does (e.g. MyFile, MyFile_DRAFT2, MyFile_da, etc.)</li>

                    <li><strong>Pull Request:</strong> When you open a pull request, you are proposing your changes and requesting that someone review those changes and pull in your contribution and merge it into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, between the content in both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red. As soon as you make a commit, you can make a pull request. Making pull requests in your own repository and merging them yourself is a good way to learn the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.</li>
            </ul>
